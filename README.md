# Reddit App: Server

Server for a minimalistic **Reddit client**.

The client repo is hosted [here](https://github.com/Chuck-Gibson/reddit-app).

## API for posts

Raw API response from Reddit has a lot of information that would not be needed
for this project.

Relevent data has been extracted and [documented](./docs).

## Dependencies

1. ExpressJS: server
2. CORS: Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
3. Axios: to make requests
4. Nodemon (dev dependencies): hot reload server on bufwrite.

Don't forget to `npm i` after cloning to install dependencies :).

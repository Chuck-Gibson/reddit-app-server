# Reddit App: Server

Server for a reddit client, this client repo is hosted [here](https://github.com/Chuck-Gibson/reddit-app).

## IMPORTANT

Currently we are not implementing `OAuth2` authentication, though we will
be expanding the project

Some API endpoints are set up for just frontend stuff at the moment,
but I will update this README as we go along.
